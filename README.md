# vimconfig
My vim configuration both Windows and Linux.

Windows 10 Configuration:
Intended to be used with Gvim, but works on any terminal emulator. 
The only plugin in use is VimCompletesMe, and was manually installed without a plugin manager.
The default shell has been set to Powershell not Command Prompt. 
Torte colorscheme has been slightly modified, to make highlighted words easier to read.
