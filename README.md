# vimconfig
My vim configuration for both Windows and Linux.

Windows 10 Configuration:
Intended to be used with Gvim, but works with any terminal emulator. 
The only plugin in use is VimCompletesMe by ajh17, and was manually installed without a plugin manager.
The default shell has been set to Powershell not Command Prompt. 
Torte colorscheme has been slightly modified, to make highlighted words easier to read.

Linux Configuration:
Intended to be used with a temrinal emulator, but works well with Gvim.
The only plugin in use is VimCompletesMe by ajh17, and was manually installed without a plugin manager.
The default shell has been set bash.
Uses the mojave-vim-theme colorscheme by marcopaganini.
